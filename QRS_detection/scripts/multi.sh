# dat - signal recordings from the database

# qrs - annotations of implemented algorithm

# If your implementation is in Matalab, then comment out compiling and running
# the C program and just use the part for evaluation (bxb and sumstats).

# Other explanations of how to run programs and convert records and annotation 
# files are described on the web-classrom under certain laboratory sessions.
